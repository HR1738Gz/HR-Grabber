## Installation
We got a auto bat system

### 1. Turn off antivirus:

```
Select Start  and type "Windows Security" to search for that app.

Select the Windows Security app from the search results, go to Virus & threat protection, and under Virus & threat protection settings select Manage settings.

Switch Real-time protection to Off. Note that scheduled scans will continue to run. However, files that are downloaded or installed will not be scanned until the next scheduled scan.
```
### 2. Download The Files:

```
Once you've downloaded the files extract the folder so it's no longer a .zip file.
```
### 3. Open The install_python.bat.bat File:

```
You dont need to install  python opening install_python.bat will install it for you.
```
### 4. Open The install.bat File:

```
You dont need to install any modules opening setup.bat will install them for you.
```
### 5. Create A Webhook:

```
This webhook will be sent any victims you log so don't delete it once it's made. Once you've created one paste it
into the box which asks for your webhook.
```
### 6. Configurable Options:

```
Now once you've done that you can tick on the options that you want enabled and anything you don't understand you can go 
to the documentation where each option is explained.
```
### 7. What Now?

```
The .exe file will appear in the same folder where all the other files are with the name you set it as and you can now send
this to your victims.ðŸ˜ˆ
